## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Sections 23.1-23.2 | 23.7, 23.17

## Progression

This week is our last full week of class!  We'll first look at Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and then explore authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ).

Monday: We will introduce RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Tuesday: We will continue working with APIs, including understanding the provider's requirements for requests and translating to the proper HTTP for making the requests, via a case study using the GitHub API.

Wednesday: Project work day -- this time, in class, with reminders for maximizing your final project grade.

Friday: We will introduce the concepts of authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ).
