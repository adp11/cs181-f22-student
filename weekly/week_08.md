This week, we first all enjoy some well-deserved rest for Fall Break.  Then, we'll finish our exploration of XPath as a declarative alternative when working with `lxml`'s `etree` module.  Then, we introduce HTML as a subset of XML, preparing us try some web scraping next week.

Monday: Fall Break!

Tuesday: Fall Break!

Wednesday: Complete software lab on using XPath.

Friday: Introduce HTML and its structure.
