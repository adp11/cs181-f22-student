  - \[Review\] Lists and Dictionaries
  - Dictionaries, DoL 2D representation
  - New Python Features
      - Functions as objects
      - Lambda functions
      - List comprehensions
  - Review so far

## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Section 3.1 | 3.1, 3.7, 3.10 
Tuesday    | Sections 3.2 and 3.4.1 | 3.35, 3.102, 3.104
Wednesday  | Section 3.3  | 3.57, 3.59, 3.62
Friday     | n/a          | n/a

## Progression

Goal of the week is finish review topics and introduce additional Python functionality, which will enable us to begin discussing 2D representations of tabular data.

Monday: Refresh various Python patterns (e.g., accumulation) using lists.

Tuesday: Review/learn about dictionaries and build dictionary-of-list representations of data.  

Wednesday: Learn about functions as objects, lambda functions, and ilst comprehensions.

Friday: Optional review Q&A over zoom.

## Projected Homework

HW | Day Assigned  | Day Due (by 11:59pm) | Contents
:--|:--------|:--------|:------------
[HW_1.c](../hw/HW_1.c/README.md) | Friday (9/2) | Monday (9/5) | Python review (cont'd), file processing
[HW_1.d](../hw/HW_1.d/README.md) | Monday (9/5) | Wednesday (9/7) | Common list patterns
HW_1.e | Wednesday (9/7) | Monday (9/12) | Functions as objects, lambda functions, and list comprehensions

We will be spending Friday reviewing over zoom, so the due date of HW 1.e is pushed back to Monday (at 11:59pm).

## Tuesday Software Lab

In the [second software lab](../sw_lab/lab_02/README.md), we'll explore dictionaries as well as the dictionary-of-lists (DoL) representation of data.

As we won't have in-person class or office hours Friday, the software lab checkoffs are also due Monday (at 4pm).
